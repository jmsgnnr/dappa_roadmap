## 1. What is Agile?


### **An Agile Roadtrip**:car::cloud:
Imagine you're on a road trip with your friends, and you want to reach your destination as quickly and efficiently as possible. Instead of meticulously planning every single detail of the trip from start to finish, Agile suggests a different approach.

Agile is like having a GPS navigation system for your road trip. You have a general idea of where you want to go, but you're also open to making adjustments and taking detours along the way. You constantly adapt to changing road conditions, traffic, and even the preferences of your fellow travelers.

In an Agile mindset, you break down your journey into small, manageable chunks. You set short-term goals or milestones, like reaching the next city or landmark, rather than planning the entire trip upfront. You regularly assess your progress, get feedback from your friends, and make course corrections as needed.

#### Adjacent Roles:
- **Iteration Manager:** An Iteration Manager, also known as an Agile Project Manager or Delivery Manager, focuses on managing the iteration or sprint cycle. They facilitate the planning, coordination, and execution of iterations, ensuring that teams are aligned, tasks are on track, and impediments are addressed.

- **Kanban Lead:** A Kanban Lead oversees the implementation and maintenance of Kanban systems within teams or organizations. They work closely with teams to establish visual workflows, set work-in-progress limits, and continuously improve the flow of work.

- **Product Owner:** While the Product Owner has distinct responsibilities, there are some overlaps with the Scrum Lead role. Product Owners are responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, collaborating with stakeholders, and ensuring the team delivers value to the customers.

- **Release Manager:** A Release Manager coordinates the planning and execution of software releases. They work closely with the development team, stakeholders, and other teams involved in the release process to ensure smooth and timely releases.

- **DevOps Engineer:** A DevOps Engineer focuses on the collaboration and integration of development and operations teams. They help streamline the software delivery pipeline, automate processes, and ensure smooth deployment and operations.

- **Project Manager:** While traditional project management and Agile project management have distinct approaches, some organizations blend the two. In such cases, the Project Manager takes on the responsibility of managing the overall project, including coordinating activities, managing resources, and ensuring successful delivery.
